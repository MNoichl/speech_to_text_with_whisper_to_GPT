        "This notebook provides a workflow to turn a dictation, which you can create e.g. with Audacity on your PC, into a reasonable piece of text of the genre that you need. After transcribing your text using the whisper model, the notebook passes it to GPT-4, with the instructions to fix any dictation infedilities, and to adapt it to your predefined style, usually without any typos.\n",
        "\n",
        "I use this for E-Mails, to-do-lists, drafting, meeting-minutes and also to turn ramblings into reasonable notes. You can also dictate several E-mails in a row. No need to worry to much about pauses as well. The GitHub-repo contains also a (hopefully growing) style-sheet, and a notebook that helps in the creation of styles.\n",
        "\n",
        "Importantly, for this to work, you will need an OpenAi-API-key, and pay for your usage. I feel this is quite reasonably priced, but until you get a feeliong for it, I suggest you monitor your spending! Also **make sure to double check your texts**. E.g. dictated last names in E-Mails are commonly mispelled, and might need post-hoc fixing. First, we need to install some stuff:"
